# Lotus Mobile App

To redefine the way people rent long term and short term apartments. To improve the process in every imaginable way. No rent contracts. It is all month to month.
Make it super easy to rent a whole apartment, or just a room. Rent a room with friends you already know or find others that you donâ€™t know to rent an apartment with. 
Use bank account and cashflow to determine max monthly pre approval, in replace of pay stubs, proof of employment etc. So they can login with their bank account using plaid: https://plaid.com
This app will look a lot like Airbnb. 

## Getting Started

For development you must run this command. 

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```


We use three packages that generate automated dart files in our application to speed up development. They are

 - functional_widget: ^0.7.1
 - mobx_codegen: ^0.3.9+1
 - built_value_generator: ^6.7.1

In order for them to create the automatically generated file you must run: 

You know a file is automatically generated by having a `.g.dart` in the file name

## Environments
In the env directory there are 5 files that contain the environment vars for the project. 

If using vs_code you can select which file to run/build from the `lib/builds` directory.

Please contact Brian for more information

```
flutter run -t lib/builds/local.dart -d {{Device Name}}
```
